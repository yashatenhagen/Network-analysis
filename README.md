# Network-analysis

This set of algorithms was created for the Network Analysis pipeline of the Dimphna Meijer Lab, Faculty of Applied Sciences, Department of Bionanoscience, TU Delft.
For more information see the work of Lukas van den Heuvel, who created the bulk of this pipeline: https://github.com/lukasvandenheuvel/CellContactNetwork

The Complete_analysis.m file is the main script, from which all the other functions are called. 
Note: It is important to also install the violinplot() function by Bastian Bechtold (https://github.com/bastibe/Violinplot-Matlab)
